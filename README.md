* Play proceeds as follows:

  * The user arrives at the landing page and is presented with a call-to-action to "Start Quiz." Also note the navigation option to "View Highscores" and the "Time" value set at 0.

  * Clicking the "Start Quiz" button presents the user with a series of questions. The timer is initialized with a value and immediately begins countdown.

  * Score is calculated by time remaining. Answering quickly and correctly results in a higher score with remaining time getting added as bonus score. Answering incorrectly results in a time penalty - 10 seconds are subtracted from time remaining.

  * When time runs out and/or all questions are answered, the user is presented with their final score and asked to enter their initials. Their final score and initials are then displayed on the Leaderboard along with the previous play history. 

  * The clear button clears the play history while back button takes the user back to the homepage and given option to play the quizzes again.
